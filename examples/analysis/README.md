### ubet/
Tooling, examples, and other artifacts of the UBet paper that are not yet integrated into main PolyTracker. This tooling is generally referenced from Dockerfiles in the parent directory.

### analysis/
Small scripts and other assorted tooling which might be copied into containers or run in the native working environment to automate learning about how Polytracker works.

The point of these is reproduceability and knowledge sharing.
